# Urban Planning RetinalCNN

## About
A powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for urban development analysis and planning using satellite imagery. This model excels at detecting and segmenting key urban features including:

- Building footprints and infrastructure
- Road networks and transportation corridors
- Green spaces and vegetation coverage
- Urban density patterns
- Development zones and land use

## Key Features
- RGB satellite imagery processing
- Multi-scale feature detection
- Real-time development monitoring
- High-resolution output masks
- Customizable layer architecture
- Built with TensorFlow 2.x

## Installation Guide
